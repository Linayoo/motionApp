# Motion: Social Media App

Focused on React & Redux, we built social media application called "Motion". Users can upload posts with images, connect with friends, or follow the other users and like posts. They can also see their own profile page or the other users' profile pages.

My task was creating the login page and the registration/validation page, fetching data from the API.
- Login page: when an existing user submits their email & password, the API returns an access and refresh token. The tokens were stored in the Redux store.
- Registration page: New users can submit their email address and after hitting the "Submit" button, the API will save this user's email and mark it as "in-active". The user will be redirected to the validation page. 
- Validation page: Notifies user that email submission was successful. The user will receive a validation code by email. The user can navigate to the verification page.
- Verification page: User can submit validation code and basic profile info such as username, first name, last name and password.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
